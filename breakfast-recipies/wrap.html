    <ul>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <li>10 round (15cm-diameter) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>6 bacon rashers, rind and excess fat trimmed, thinly sliced crossways</li>
        <li>12 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
        <li>125ml (1/2 cup) thickened cream</li>
        <li>Salt & freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>20g butter</li>
        <li>120g (1 1/2 cups) coarsely grated cheddar</li>
        <li>4 green shallots, ends trimmed, thinly sliced</li>

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h4>Make it hot</h4>
        <li>Preheat oven to 160Â°C. Wrap the tortillas in foil. 
            Place in preheated oven for 10 minutes or until hot.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h4>Make it ready</h4>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a medium non-stick frying pan over medium heat.
             Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until crisp.
              Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h4>What goes in</h4>
        <li>Whisk together egg and cream in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
             Melt butter in a heavy-based saucepan over medium-low heat until foaming.
              Add egg mixture and use a flat-edged wooden spoon to gently push the egg mixture, 
              scraping the spoon along the base of the pan, from 1 side to the other in 4 different 
              directions. Repeat pushing action every 10 seconds, including around the edge of the pan,
               to prevent egg sticking. Cook for 5 minutes or until three-quarters of the egg mixture is
                cooked, but mixture is still creamy and slightly liquid. Remove from heat. Stir in the bacon./li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h4>Time to serve</h4>
        <li>Transfer scrambled eggs to a warm serving bowl.
             Garnish with a little of the cheese and green shallot.
              Serve immediately with hot tortillas and the remaining cheese and green shallot.</li>
    </ul>
